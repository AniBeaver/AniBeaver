[//]: # (# AniBeaver - Information)

[//]: # ()
AniBeaverKotlin is a cross-platform anime and manga tracker application built with Compose Multiplatform.

With AniBeaver, you can keep track of anime you watched and manga you've read by adding them as Entries. Along with your
own rating and custom information like name, year released, studio/author etc, you can filter your entries by custom
tags, set your own cover art, etc, track your episode/chapter progress, etc.
By default, Entries are grouped by your current status like "Watching", "Planning" or "Dropped".

Everything from the animation studios to the cover and banner artworks can be automatically inferred from the AniList
database via a smart Reference feature. Optionally, an entry can have references to multiple seasons of the same series.

With Quick Add, all you have to do is type in an anime name, and a Reference (along with all inferrable information)
will be autocompleted. All that's left is to leave your rating, progress/status and Confirm!

AniBeaver is offline-first, which means it is used locally on your computer and never records or uploads your data -
only thing it does with the internet is pull data on anime entries for the autofill from AniList.

This is a Beta version. There are plans for more functionality (sync with AniList, better navigation, UI rework, etc)
and more compatibility (Android, iOS beside Windows, Linux and MacOS support). Please Export from Settings to back-up
your entry collection! Just in case.

Any and all concerns/suggestions with functionality/user experience/potential bugs are welcome in our Discord.
